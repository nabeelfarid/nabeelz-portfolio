      "description": "One of the principles of JAMstack is that of pre-rendering. In other words, it generates your site into a collection of static assets in advance, so that it can be served to your visitors with maximum speed and minimum overhead from a CDN or other optimized static hosting environment. But if we are going to pre-generate our sites ahead of time, how do we make them feel dynamic? How do we build sites that need to change often? How do we work with things like user generated content?",
